##CanalCan
>CanalCan is a video uploading tool/website.
It is used to watch/upload videos without trying to control the user.
CanalCan is "free" and I'm not talking about the price.
"free" as in "freedom".
It will not try to control you.
###Specifications
>CanalCan will also provide with the use of command-line video uploading.
something like this:

	canalcan -upload <username> <password> video.mp4 <tag(s)>
