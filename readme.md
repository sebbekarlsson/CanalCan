###What is CanalCan?
>CanalCan is a video uploading tool/website.
It is used to watch/upload videos without trying to control the user.
CanalCan is "free" and I'm not talking about the price.
"free" as in "freedom".
It will not try to control you.

###Command-line

something like this:

    canalcan -upload video.mp4 <tag(s)>
###Video player
